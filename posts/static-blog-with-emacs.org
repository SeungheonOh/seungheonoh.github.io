Multiple options were available for building a static website: Hugo,
Jekyll, ox-static. Most, however, require some extra tags, settings,
or other tweaks to work with plain Emacs Org file.

Seeing Pandoc--an awesome program that converts the document type
flawlessly--converting Org files into a simple, good looking, and stand
alone html pages made me choose Pandoc over other frameworks.

Pandoc does not have incremental building or static cite builder; it
is just a page generator. So, I wrote a simple script in Emacs Lisp to
generate all htmls for posts in directory and also to generate the
index page which contains all the links to posts. It's quite simple,
so I wouldn't bother to explain it in detail.

For the most part, Pandoc did its job terrifically. The rendered pages
looks great and pages are linked correctly. The images are also
rendered correctly; I used org-download with its download path set to
"resources" to make it simple and easy to add resource path to
Pandoc.

#+begin_src elisp
  (setq org-download-image-dir "./resources")
#+end_src
#+begin_src bash 
  pandoc --to html5+smart         \ # Output format
         --template=template.html \ # HTML Template to add home button
         --css tufte.css          \ # CSS file used
         --self-contained         \ # Embed css into html
         --resource-path posts    \ # Resource path
         -o docs/out.html         \ # Input
            in.org 
#+end_src

It's missing some features other sites provide by default. Sort by
tags, image previews, and the list goes on--features that I don't need
and don't think worth wasting time on...
